// In this topic we will learn about AJAX (Ayschronous javascript and xml).

// HTTP Request

// Basic theory.
// AJAX is a basic set of "Web develpment".
// Using many web techniques on the "client-side".
// to create asynchronous "web-application".

// With AJAX web applcation can send retrieve data from server Ayschronously (in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

// We don't use data in XML format anymore.
// We use JSON now.

// We have 3 simple ways to create and send request to server.
// 1. xmlHTTPRequest (Old way of doing).
// 2. Fetch API (new way of doing).
// 3. AXIOUS (this is the third party library).
