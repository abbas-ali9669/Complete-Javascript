// In this topic we will learn about how we can concatinate two strnig into one. Means joining two strings

let string1 = "Abbas";
let string2 = "Ali";

let newString = string1 + " " + string2;
console.log(newString);

// For joining two numbers
let num1 = "10";
let num2 = "10";

// Now ho we can add these two strings into one adde output
// Now here we use our trick to add these two numbers with the + symbol
let sum = +num1 + +num2;
// let sum = Number(num1) + Number(num2)
console.log(sum);
