// In this topic we will learn about how we can practice the for loop. With the same example that we dii with the while loop.

let total = 0
for(let i=0; i<=10; i++){
    total += i;
}

console.log(total)


// With some consept clearance with while loop
let i = 0;
while(i <= 10){
    if(i === 7){
        break;
    }
    console.log("hello world");
    i++;
}
