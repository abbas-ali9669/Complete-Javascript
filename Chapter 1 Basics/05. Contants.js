// In this lecture we will talk about constant/constant variable

const pi = 3.14;
console.log(pi)

// NOTE - We cannot change the value of constant. Because it is constant. If we do, the error will occur.
// As in the rule we cannot call this constant as a variable. We should call it directly constant.
// i-e: Declare a constant

// pi = 3.15;    // Error
// BUt we can use as this as normal
console.log(pi*2+3);
