// In this topic we will learn about some practice program of while loop.
// The practice program of while loop is "Sum of natural numbers"

// let userInput = +prompt('Input the number : ') // With the userinput

let total = 0;
let i = 1;
while (i<=10){
    total += i;
    i++;
}
console.log(total)

// Do in the mathematics the basic formula of the function is
let num = 10;
let func = (num*(num+1))/2;
console.log(func);

// The fastest method is the second one. Because it is constant. And the loop one is linear, because that is processing, and the formula one is giving the driect value(constant).
